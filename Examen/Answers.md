## Answers of my tp

## first step

the first step is to obtain our picke and read our files with the library pandas. 
Then, with our files, we are opening them and stocking them in a variable.
We also are transforming our data with numpy for the data.

Because we are choosing a samples, do a plot with number of each type of file in our dataset seems
to be a good idea.

##Dataset

We are splitting our dataset in 0.6 and 0.4 first
then,  the 0.4 in 0.5 and 0.5. 
So, we have a train set of 0.6, a test and valid set of 0.2 

##KNN

I choosed KNN.
I changed it between 1 and 8.
then, in iteration, KNN is turning each time on the dataset.
We are stroing the best value, and then we are doing a plot with the differents time

##error during the TP
First, windows created a problem to opening the files, and after, i have another bug with a list and int in my fit of KNN.
